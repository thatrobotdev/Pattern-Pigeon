# üê¶ Pattern Pigeon

> Coo coo! I'm Pattern Pigeon‚Äìyour feathered friend here to help you understand software architecture patterns like Strategy, Composite, and Observer. I might ruffle in a few pigeon facts too. What are you curious about today?

Pattern Pigeon is a [deterministic](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/generative-deterministic#deterministic)[^1] conversational assistant built with Google Cloud's [Dialogflow CX](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/cx/projects) to teach the [Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern), [Composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern), and [Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) design patterns.

[^1]: All responses are generated by the agent, without generative input from a large language model (LLM). However, Flows use language models for understanding end-user intention, which may not be completely deterministic.

## Contributing

Follow the instructions from [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/github) to set up GitHub integration:

1. If you're contributing: [fork this repository](https://github.com/thatrobotdev/Pattern-Pigeon/fork).
2. Create a [fine-grained personal access token](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/github#access_token) from [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). (Read-only is fine if you're not contributing.)
3. [Create a secret](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/github) for the token in the Dialogflow CX console.
4. [Configure Git export/restore integration](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/github#dialogflow_config) for your Dialogflow CX agent.
5. Pull the agent from GitHub!
6. If contributing, push your changes and **rebase or amend any unintended edits.**  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Dialogflow CX **overwrites the entire branch** on push from the console, so make sure to:
   - Commit only intended changes.
   - Compare changes made in the dashboard vs. those you want to keep.
   - Optionally, make edits in a local text editor and manage them manually.
